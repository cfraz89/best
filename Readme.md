# hevy-rs

A work in progress web framework for rust.

Its goals are:
- Adds a frontend to a standard rust backend application, eg a page can be served from a route in an axum app
- Components rendered with server-side data
- Use web components to simplify hydration?
- Fine-grained (signal-based) reactivity
- Svelte-like template syntax
